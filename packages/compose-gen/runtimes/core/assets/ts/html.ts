 * Trusted markup. A prop of type `TrustedHtml` carries markup from a trusted source (the `|html` pipe of readPath: the body of a
 * Codex entry, or the host), and an `html` view node prints it without escaping. Every other value is text, and is escaped.
 * The marker is React's own shape, `{ __html }`; a value without it (a plain string) is escaped by `htmlOf`, so markup is
 * printed raw only when it was marked trusted. The same rules on every runtime: og_html (PHP, Python) and Html (Go).
